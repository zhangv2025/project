  <h1>DOES LIVING ALONE IMPAIR EMOTIONAL PERCEPTION?</h1>
  <h2>A DATA STORYTELLING PROJECT EXPLORING<br>EMOTIONAL RECOGNITION IN SOLITUDE</h2>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>This project explores a counterintuitive hypothesis:</p>

  <p><strong>Long-term solitary living may reduce a person’s ability to recognize emotions in others.</strong></p>

  <p>In a post-pandemic world where isolation has become more common—especially in dense cities or among young adults—the emotional cost of living alone is worth investigating.</p>

  <p>While solitude is often romanticized as peaceful or independent, recent psychology and neuroscience research suggests that regular exposure to social cues might actually train and maintain our ability to read emotions.</p>

  <p>The goal of this project is not to label solitude as “bad,” but to explore its subtle cognitive impact.</p>

  <p>This data story uses a scroll-based visual narrative to guide viewers through that exploration—backed by real data, human insight, and emotional design.</p>

  <p>This project is presented as a scroll-based visual narrative.</p>

  <p>Each scroll represents a stage in the viewer’s emotional and analytical journey:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scroll 0 – Question & Contrast</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The project opens with a visual juxtaposition: a solitary figure in isolation versus a group engaging socially. This sets the tone and introduces the core question.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scroll 1 – Data Visualization: Bar Graph</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>A bar chart compares emotion recognition scores between people who live alone and those who live with others.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scroll 2 – Brain-Based Insight: Heatmap</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Neuroscience research is visualized with a brain heatmap, showing how emotional processing may differ between solitary and socially active individuals.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scroll 3 – Reflection & Open End</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The project closes with a reflective question: “Is emotional intelligence something we lose when we’re alone too long?”</p>

  <h2>Emotion Recognition Accuracy by Living Situation</h2>

  <p>This chart compares the average emotion recognition accuracy between two groups:</p>

  <p><strong>individuals who live alone</strong> and <strong>those who live in shared households</strong>.</p>

  <p>The data indicates that people who live alone tend to score lower on facial emotion recognition tests, possibly due to reduced exposure to social cues in daily life.</p>

  <p>While this doesn’t imply that everyone who lives alone becomes emotionally impaired, it raises a question:</p>

  <p><em>Does our ability to read emotions depend on how often we’re socially engaged?</em></p>

  <h2>Simulated Brain Activation During Emotional Processing</h2>

  <p>This simulated fMRI heatmap visualizes the brain’s activation patterns during emotional recognition tasks across different emotional conditions.</p>

  <p>The comparison focuses on individuals exposed to <strong>mixed</strong>, <strong>positive</strong>, and <strong>negative</strong> emotional stimuli, simulating cognitive activity for both socially connected and solitary groups.</p>

  <p>Key emotional regions, such as the <strong>amygdala (Amg)</strong>, <strong>hippocampus (Hipp)</strong>, <strong>prefrontal cortex (PFC)</strong>, and <strong>posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)</strong> show varying degrees of activation.</p>

  <p>Notably, <strong>socially active participants</strong> (simulated) show increased activation in emotional and social cognition areas when processing emotional content, especially under mixed or ambiguous expressions.</p>

  <p>This may suggest that social exposure helps preserve the brain’s sensitivity to nuanced emotional cues.</p>

  <h2>What Does Emotional Disconnection Look Like?</h2>

  <p>This hand-drawn illustration symbolically contrasts <strong>emotional isolation</strong> with <strong>emotional engagement</strong>.</p>

  <p>On the <strong>left</strong>, the figure appears alone—still, disconnected, emotionally contained.</p>

  <p>On the <strong>right</strong>, multiple figures interact, reflect one another’s emotions, and form a responsive loop of connection.</p>

  <p>The two sides aren’t just spatially separated—they’re <strong>emotionally asymmetrical</strong>.</p>

  <p>This isn’t about morality.</p>

  <p>It’s about mirroring.</p>

  <p>What happens when no one reflects your emotion back to you?</p>

  <h2>When No One Reflects You, Do You Still Feel Clearly?</h2>

  <p>We often think of empathy as something we <strong>have</strong>.</p>

  <p>But maybe empathy is something we <em>practice</em>.</p>

  <p>What happens when we go days—or years—without reading someone else’s face?</p>

  <p>Without seeing a smile meant for us?</p>

  <p>Without the little daily moments that keep our emotional radar tuned?</p>

  <p>Maybe emotional intelligence isn’t fixed.</p>

  <p>Maybe we need others to keep it alive.</p>
